      "Hermes is a Greek Olympian, god. Born to Zeus and Maya, Hermes is known for his quick thinking and cunning nature. He is the youngest of the Olympians and known for moving quickly between the divine and mortal worlds. Because of this power, Hermes often acted as a messenger between the men and the Olympians. A benevolent god, Hermes protects travellers and athletes. He is also known as mischievous as he often plays tricks on other gods. He does this for his own amusement or to save people from the wrath of the gods. Hermes is also the fastest of all the gods because he has wings with his sandals. Interestingly, even when Hermes was a child he could not resist the urge to steal. Therefore, he is also credited as the patron god of all thieves." +
      "Atoms of radioactive elements can split. According to Albert Einstein, mass and energy are interchangeable under certain circumstances. When atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission. In this case, a small amount of mass is converted into energy. Thus the energy released cannot do much damage. However, several subatomic particles called neutrons are also emitted during this process. Each neutron will hit a radioactive element releasing more neutrons in the process. This causes a chain reaction and creates a large amount of energy. This energy is converted into heat which expands uncontrollably causing an explosion. Hence, atoms do not literally explode. They generate energy that can cause explosions.Everyone knows that paper is made from trees. But when one looks at trees, one cannot imagine that something so soft and fragile as the paper is made is so hard and strong. Plant materials such as wood are made of fibres known as cellulose. It is the primary ingredient in paper making. Raw wood is first converted into pulp consisting of a mixture of Cellulose, lignin, water and some chemicals. The pulp can be made mechanically through grinders or through chemical processes. Short fibres are produced by mechanical grinding. The paper produced in this way is weak and is used to make newspapers, magazines and phonebooks. Through the chemical pulping process, strong paper is produced. Cellulose pulp is sprayed to form mats on moving conveyor screens. These mats are then dried, dyed and cut as required.",
